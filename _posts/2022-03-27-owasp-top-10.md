## What is OWASP?
<!-- ![](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/assets/images/mapping.png) -->


The OWASP `Open Web Application Security Project` is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the `security of software`. OWASP regularly update it's  list after certain yeras.. 
<br>

There are total` 10` most common` web applications vulnerability` which are listed in `owasp top 10`.
It was first updated in `2013 `and then `2017` and the latest release is` 2021` which we are using now.

### 1. Broken Access Control 
`Broken acess control` is flaw in web application which is occur due to ` _poor implementation_` of access control   mechanism that can be easily `exploited. 

This flaw allow attacker/unauthorised user to `access the contents` that they are not allowed to view, can perform `unauthorised functions`, even an attacker can `delete the content`, or `take over site administration`.

**Remediation**
- Proper implementations of access control to the `users.
- Delete any inactive or `unnecessary accounts`.
- Shutdown unnecessary `service` and `access point`.
- Use `multi-factor authentication` at all access points
- Disable `web server directory` listing
		

### 2. Cryptographic Failures 

 This flaw previously was known as sensitive data exposures and it arises when web application send  any data  in `plain text`, use   `outdated `and `insecure cryptographic algorithms` ,  or  `weak `crypto keys etc are called cryptographic failures.
 
> **General idea:**
>This security threats occurs when web applications does not adequately protect sensitive information like `credit cared numbere`, `password`, `banking information`, `social security number`, or any similar crucial data whose leak can be critical for the user.
{: .prompt-info }

>This flaw in in web applications can cause financial loss, access to victims accounts, blackmailing and ultimately decrease the trust in to brands.
{: .prompt-info }

**Remediation**

-  Encrypt data while it is` in transit and at rest`.
-  Use the most `up-to-date encryption` techniques.
-  `Turn off autocomplete` on forms.
-  Reduce/minimize the size of the `data surface` area.
-   Use Strong adaptive and salted hashing functions when saving passwords.



### 3. Injection

An injection attack refers to untrusted data by an application that forces it to execute commands. Such data or malicious code is inserted by an attacker and can compromise data or the whole application.

The most common injection attacks are `SQL injections` , `cross-site scripting (XSS)`, `HTML injections`, `command injections`, `CCS injection`, etc..

**Remediation**

- Separate the  commands from data.
- Data supplied by users most be validated, filtered, or sanitized.
- Use of a safe API that avoids the use of the interpreter altogether or uses parameterized queries


### 4. Insecure Design

This category of vulnerabilities is focused on the `risks associated with flaws in design and architecture`.

**Remediation**

- Development lifecycle with `AppSec professionals`
- Limit user and `service resource` consumption.
- Implement` threat modeling` for crucial `authentication`, `access control`, `business logic`, `secure design patterns` and key flows.


### 5. Security Misconfiguration 

Security misconfiguration is flaw in web applications and generally arises due to `Default configurations`, `open ports`, `privileges`, `incorrect HTTP headers` etc.

**Remediation**
-   Improving security level of `potentials flaw application`.
-   Properly `configured` permissions.
-  `Default `accounts/passwords are enabled or unchanged
-   `Error messages` should not display to users `contain sensitive` information
-   The `latest security` features should be enabled.
-   The `server`, `framework`, `libraries`, or `databases`, security settings must set to `secure values`
-  Remove the `unnecessary features`, such as `ports`, `services,` `pages` , `accounts`, or `privileges` are allowed or installed


### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components 

This category was previously known as `“Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.” Component`vulnerabilities can arise in when software is `vulnerable`,` unsupported`, or `out of date`,  or not upgraded `platform`, `framework`, and `dependencies` when patches come out.

**Remediation**

- Be aware of` versions` of client-side and server-side `components` used.
- Perform `vulnerability Assessments `to reduces attack.
- Upgrade` platform`, `framework`, and other `dependencies`.


### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures 

This is the vulnerability exists in the web application when web application does `not properly functions` related to `identifications and authentications`, like `sessions management`, `password recovery`, other l`ogin credentials.`

Because of this attacker are able to compromise password, security keys, or sessions tokens or assume to identities and permissions of other user.

**Remediation**
-   Implement `multi-factor authentication`
-   Do not deploy with `default credentials`, especially for users with admin privileges.
-   Enforce `strong passwords.`
-   Carefully `monitor failed login` attempts.
-   Use a secure session manager that generates` random`, t`ime-limited session IDs`. 
-   Never include `session IDs` in `URLs`.


### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures 
This is `new category `on the `OWASP` list relates to vulnerabilities in` software updates`, `critical data`, and `CI/CD pipelines` whose `integrity` is not verified. 

Code and infrastructure that do not guard against integrity violations are referred to as software and data integrity failures

>For example, an application that relies on plugins, libraries, or modules from unverified and untrusted sources, repositories, or content delivery networks (CDNs) may be exposed to such a type of failure.
>{: .prompt-info }

**Remediation**

- Use `digital signatures`, or other similar measures
- To protect the integrity of the code going through the `build `and `deploy` processes, make sure your` CI/CD pipeline` includes adequate `segregation`, `configuration`, and `access control`.
- Verify that `unsigned` or `unencrypted` serialised data is not delivered to `untrustworthy clients` without `integrity check` or `digital signature` to detect alteration or replay.



### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures 

It is one of the important vulnerability among `OWASP `Top 10 and previously known as `Insufficient Logging and Monitoring` . 
<br>
This flaw arises when organization do not have proper logging and monitoring tools to insure `all logs`, `detect suspicious activities` and `unauthorized access attempts`. And all the alert should be properly managed by the security professionals.


**Remediation**
- Log all login,` access control`, and `server-side input validations` failures.
- Logs must be in easily `readable format`. 


### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 

Server-side request forgery issues arise when a web application does not validate the `user-supplied URL` when fetching a `remote resource`.

**Or**

SSRF is a web security flaw that allows an attacker to force a s`erver-side application` to send` HTTP requests` to any domain the attacker choose.

**Remediation**

-   Implement `input validation`.
-   Use Regular Expressions (`RegEx`).
-   Only `accept `the` intended IP address format` (IPv4 or IPv6).
-   `Validate` incoming Domain Names.
