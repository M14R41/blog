Hi , I am `Madhuredra Kumar` and here is some detail about me.
I am an `Information Security Enthusiast` and `Security Researcher` looking forward to be a `Certified Ethical `Hacker and join red team member.
I will be Graduate by the end of this year in Bachelor of Computer Application. I have been into InfoSec by this year but in computer's science field for long time.

I have knowledge of `Web Application`, `Computer Networking`, `Bash-Scripting`, `Major programing language along` with all major O/S and learning Network Penetration Testing, VAPT, Bug Hunting and Some Red Team Attack Vectors. I am expanding my skills on TryHackMe and Hackthebox plateform.
